## Setup

I used a CORS proxy so you will need to be granted permission to use it in order to use this app.

Go to https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/ and request temporary access in order to use CORS proxy. Access should be instantly granted.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
